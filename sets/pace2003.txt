It was introduced in a paper on the interpretation of matrix mechanics which included a thought experiment with a gamma-ray microscope. Part of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, it weakens causality since perfect information is impossible. For 10 points-name this principle stating the a subatomic particle's position and momentum cannot be simultaneously and precisely known.;;Heisenberg uncertainty|Heisenberg indeterminacy;;
